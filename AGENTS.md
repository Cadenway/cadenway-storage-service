# cadenway-storage-service: agent instructions

These instructions are mandatory for every AI assistant working in this repository, whatever the
vendor. [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) imports them for Claude Code. Explicit user instructions take
precedence over procedures, never over the hard limits below.

This file states the **rules**. See the tooling guides for [Claude Code](.claude/README.md)
and [Codex](.codex/README.md) for agents, skills, commands and hooks.

## First read

- The `MODULE.md` of the module you touch, and `src/app.module.ts` for the module list.
- `@cadenway/contracts` (installed) and `../cadenway-api-contracts`: `openapi/internal/storage-service.yaml` and `asyncapi/storage-service.yaml`.
- The [repositories document](https://claude.ai/artifact/BPinmYxoF3mbK8w9BMB43N), section "cadenway-storage-service", and the data model of the [integration guide](https://claude.ai/artifact/CpJHVCiFfF9j3KbHQ2S1Et).
- The mockup screens this service serves: Attachments and their full-screen preview; Organisation › Quotas (largest files).
- `package.json` for versions and scripts once the repository is bootstrapped. Do not restate
  versions elsewhere: a copy goes stale.

## What this repository is

The structure and workflows below describe the bootstrap target. Check the checkout for available files and commands.

cadenway-storage-service owns file storage for attachments. NestJS, its own PostgreSQL database (one database and one user in the shared PostgreSQL of the VPS), events over NATS JetStream through `@cadenway/nest-messaging`, internal REST for the API gateway. Local port 3015.

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data       | File metadata (name, type, size, author, linked task or comment); the files themselves live in object storage. |
| API        | Signed upload and download URLs, the 25 MB per-file limit, an organization's largest files.                    |
| Emits      | `file.uploaded`, `file.deleted`                                                                                |

| Phase      | Extracted later, when needed                                                                                   |

Starts as a module of cadenway-task-service.

## Language

- Everything written in the repository is **English**: code, comments, docs, agent prompts, rules,
  skills, commit messages, branch names, PR titles and descriptions.
- Follow the user's language in the conversation only. No emojis.
- Never invent facts about the product, the contracts, the mockup or the tooling: cite the file or
  the document. When something does not exist yet, say so and say which step of the start-up plan
  brings it.

## Architectural ownership

See the [Cadenway NestJS architecture reference](https://github.com/Cadenway/cadenway-service-kit/blob/main/docs/hexagonal-architecture.md) for dependency and test rules.

- Business code lives in modules under `src/modules/<module>/`, each with `domain/`, `application/`, `infrastructure/`, `api/` and a `MODULE.md`.
- Cross-cutting plumbing (config, logging, tracing, errors, auth guards, messaging) comes from the cadenway-service-kit packages (`@cadenway/nest-common`, `@cadenway/nest-messaging`, `@cadenway/nest-testing`), never re-implemented here.
- The domain is pure; use cases own transactions; controllers and handlers translate.
- Rendering of anything user-facing belongs to the webapp; this service returns data and stable error codes.

## Boundaries (hard rules)

- No access to another service's database or internal code; cross-service needs use `@cadenway/contracts` routes or events.
- NATS only through `@cadenway/nest-messaging`; config, logs, errors, health and auth guards through `@cadenway/nest-common`.
- Routes and event payloads come from the installed `@cadenway/contracts`; never redefine them locally.
- The service is internal: no Traefik label, no public route; the API gateway is its only HTTP caller.
- No sibling sources imported, no `file:` or `link:` dependency on a sibling.

## GitHub files (`.github/`)

This repository carries everything GitHub reads from it; Cadenway has no organization `.github`
repository and nothing is inherited.

- [`.github/README.md`](.github/README.md) is the repository home page; `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and
  `CODEOWNERS` sit next to it.
- `.github/workflows/` holds this repository's complete CI, release and deploy workflows: no reusable
  workflow from another repository. The Renovate configuration is complete here too, with no shared
  preset.
- The parts shared with the other repositories are duplicated on purpose; a change to them is repeated
  in each repository through its own pull request.

## Commands and quality gates

The scripts below are this repository's contract. While the repository is being bootstrapped,
create them with these exact names; afterwards, use them and never an ad-hoc equivalent. Run the
narrowest check that covers the change first, then widen:

| Changed                         | Minimum check                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Domain or use case code         | `pnpm test <module>`, then `pnpm test:coverage`              |
| Persistence, events, migrations | `pnpm test:integration <module>`                             |
| Routes                          | `pnpm test <module>/api` and the contract tests              |
| Any source                      | `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`           |
| Build or runtime configuration  | `pnpm build`, `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml config -q` |
| Docs or agent instructions only | Scoped formatting and link review                            |

Report the commands you actually ran and their results; a check you did not run is reported as not
run.

## Git and branch flow

- Trunk-based: work branches come from `main`, named `<type>/<lowercase-kebab-description>` with a
  type among `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`,
  `revert`; put the Cadenway task id first when there is one (`feat/cad-482-sso-screen`). Never an
  agent name as a prefix. Validate with `git check-ref-format --branch <name>`.
- Commits and PR titles follow Conventional Commits: `type(scope): subject`, English, imperative,
  lowercase subject, no trailing period, at most 100 characters; `!` only for a breaking change.
- Pull requests target `main` and are squash-merged after review and green CI. release-please opens the release pull request; its merge tags the version, publishes the image to GHCR, and the deploy workflow of this repository (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) writes the new version into cadenway-ops (staging, then production after approval).
- Stage only the files of your task; preserve other people's changes in the working tree.

## Hard limits (never without the user's explicit request in this conversation)

- Never push to `main`, merge into it locally, create or push Git tags, or bump a version by hand.
- Never run a registry publish (`npm publish`, `pnpm publish`): this repository ships as a Docker image built by CI.
- Never force-push, and never amend or rebase commits that are already pushed.
- Never bypass the Git hooks (`--no-verify`, `core.hooksPath` overrides, `ALLOW_MAIN_PUSH=1`,
  `CW_SKIP_PUSH_CHECKS=1`).
- Never write a token, password or private key anywhere; `.npmrc` keeps `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}`. Do
  not read or write secret environment files; new variables are documented in `.env.example`.
- Never edit generated trees (`dist/`, `node_modules/`, `coverage/`, generated clients) or lockfiles by hand.
- Never modify a sibling checkout (`../cadenway-*`) from a task in this repository.
- Never write into another service's database, even for a "quick fix".
- Never edit a merged migration.

The agent hooks enforce most of these mechanically; a refused command is a signal to stop and ask,
not to find another way around it.

## Agent tooling

- **Claude Code**: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [.claude/README.md](.claude/README.md): the
  `cw-storage-*` agents, the `/cw-*` commands (`/cw-quality` runs the whole local gate),
  path-scoped rules and hooks.
- **Codex**: [.codex/README.md](.codex/README.md) covers the specialists, `$cw-*` skills, rules and hooks.
- **Builders** (assigned writes): `cw-storage-module-builder`, `cw-storage-domain-builder`, `cw-storage-usecase-builder`, `cw-storage-endpoint-builder`, `cw-storage-event-builder`, `cw-storage-persistence-builder`, `cw-storage-migration-builder`, `cw-storage-test-writer`, `cw-storage-deploy-maintainer`, `cw-storage-github-maintainer`.
- **Reviewers** (read-only): `cw-storage-module-explorer`, `cw-storage-architecture-reviewer`, `cw-storage-contract-reviewer`, `cw-storage-security-auditor`, `cw-storage-observability-reviewer`, `cw-storage-performance-reviewer`.
- Specialists are available, not mandatory. Delegate a bounded responsibility with explicit files and
  checks, assign disjoint files to parallel agents and integrate their results yourself.

## Repository hygiene

- Reuse existing commands, tools and test infrastructure before adding files.
- Prefer inline commands or a task-specific temporary directory for one-off diagnostics; clean up
  disposable files before delivery.
- Keep a permanent script only when it provides a reusable capability that existing tooling cannot.
- Add permanent tests for meaningful behavior or regressions, in the existing test structure.
- Before delivery, inspect untracked files and remove only the disposable artifacts of the current
  task. Report every new permanent tooling file and why it needs to stay.
- Report material failures, skipped checks and limitations, including non-blocking ones. Ask for
  user input only when a missing decision or authorization blocks the dependent work.
