Starts as a module of cadenway-task-service.

## Getting started

Requirements: Node.js LTS and pnpm (versions in `package.json`), and Docker.

1. Clone this repository next to the other Cadenway repositories, flat, in one folder.
2. To run it with the rest of Cadenway, start the stack from `cadenway-ops`; it builds the sibling
   folders, this one included (`core` profile; `full` adds every other service):

   ```bash
   cd ../cadenway-ops/compose
   docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.local.yaml --profile core up -d
   ```

3. To work on this repository alone:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm start:dev              # http://localhost:3015
   ```

## Checks

Run the narrowest check first; CI runs them all on every pull request.

```bash
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test src/modules/<module>      # targeted
pnpm test:integration                    # PostgreSQL and NATS in Docker
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm build
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml config -q
```
